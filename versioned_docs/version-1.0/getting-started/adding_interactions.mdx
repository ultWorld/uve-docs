# Adding Interactivity

Now, we have the world. We can add interactivity to our world. 
There are a lot of different kind of interactive elements like meeting tables, youtube panels, games built by UltimateWorld and open source independent creators like you.

For this tutorial, we will create a simple spawn point. Every world needs this to spawn players.



## Create a spawn point
![Create Spawn Point](/img/getting_started/spawnpoint.png)

To add interactivity to your world, such as spawning points, triggers, animations and sounds, you need to follow these steps:

### Switch to top view

To switch to the top view in Blender:

- Press `Numpad 7` on your keyboard or select **View > Top** from the menu bar.

### Create the spawn point

- Hold `Shift` and `right click` on any location on the floor of your world where you want the user to spawn. This will set the 3D cursor at that location.
- Go to the BYOM tab on the right side of the screen and click on Create Spawn Point. It will create few empty objects. This is the spawn point object.

      Tip: If the button is greyed out, make sure that no object is selected.

## Future Plans

Other **interative elements** and module for user created interactions is coming soon to **BYOM**.
