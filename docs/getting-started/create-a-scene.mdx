# Create a World

Once you have installed Blender and the BYOM plugin, you can start creating your scene in Blender. You can use any of the built-in tools and features of Blender to model, sculpt, texture, light and animate your scene. You can also import assets from other sources or use add-ons to enhance your workflow.

## Create our scene in Blender


For this tutorial, we will create a simple scene with Stone Hedge Face World. Here are the steps:

### Step 1 - Open Blender 
Open Blender and with cursor in main viewport press `A` delete the default scene by pressing `X` and selecting **Delete**. Now, we have a fresh plate to start.
### Step 2 - Add a plane with ocean texture
Add a by pressing `Shift + A` and selecting **Mesh > Plane**. Scale it up by pressing `S` and dragging the mouse.
<ReactPlayer controls url='/img/getting_started/clip1.mp4' />
<br/>

Select the plane we just created and Click on the Ocean to give the plane a texture of ocean.

    Tip: Press N if you dont see the BYOM plugin on the right side

Select the floor cube and click on Apply to Object in the BYOM plugin.
